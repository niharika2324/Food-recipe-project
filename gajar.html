      <p class="paragraph1"> <b>What is Halwa ?</b><br>The word halwa comes from the Arabic word for “sweet,” and refers to desserts that are cooked with ghee and sugar. Whether made with noodles (vermicelli), lentils (moong dal), grains (like semolina), or vegetables (like carrots or beets), Indian halwa is a pudding that is absolutely delectable.

        Contrary to popular belief, Indian halwa is different from Middle Eastern halva, which is a candy made primarily from sesame seeds.
        
        Halwa is a yummy dessert that is reserved for celebratory occasions. It isn’t difficult to make, but it does tend to take a bit of time.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph2"> <b>What is  Carrot Halwa ?</b><br>Carrot halwa is a popular sweet made in North India, and it is especially popular during winters. The traditional gajar ka halwa recipe is made with only carrots, whole (full-fat) milk, ghee and sugar; there’s no need for khoya (evaporated milk solids) or condensed milk.</p><br><br>
      <div>
        <h2>STEPS TO MAKE</h2><br>
        <p class="paragraph3"><b>1. GRATE CARROTS: </b>First rinse 650 grams carrots (8 to 9 medium-sized tender, juicy carrots or 6 to 7 long carrots) a few times in water.

          Drain the water.<br> Peel the carrots using a vegetable peeler. Set the peeled carrots aside.
          
          Ensure that the carrots are juicy and tender. You could use any variety of carrots (red or orange), but they should be tender.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph3">2. <b>Next</b>, grate the carrots with a box grater or in a food processor. You can measure the grated carrots with a standard measuring cup and you will need about 4 to 4.5 cups of grated carrots.
          Grating carrots in a food processor is much easier than grating with a box grater or a hand-held grater.</p>


          <p class="paragraph3">3. <b>Cook Carrots</b> In a heavy kadai or wok, add all of the grated carrots.</p>

          <p class="paragraph3">4.  <b>Pour</b> in 4 cups full-fat milk. Switch on the burner.</p>

          <p class="paragraph3">5.  <b> Mix </b>the grated carrots and milk together.</p>
          
          <p class="paragraph3">6. <b>Cook</b> this mixture on a low-medium heat. After a few minutes, the milk will begin to froth and then start slowly reducing.</p>

          <p class="paragraph3">7.<b>Keep</b>stirring this halwa mixture often, scraping the sides of the kadai to remove the evaporated milk solids. Stir the milk solids into the cooking mixture. </p>

          <p class="paragraph3">8. <b>Cook</b> the carrot and milk mixture until the liquid is reduced by 75%.</p>

        <p class="paragraph3">9. <b>Add</b> 4 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter). Note that some milk will be there when you add the ghee.</p>

        <p class="paragraph3">10. <b>Mix</b> very well.</p>

        <p class="paragraph3">11. <b>Next</b>  add 10 to 12 tablespoons sugar, or to taste.</p>

        <p class="paragraph3">12. <b>Add</b> cardamom powder – 5 to 6 green cardamom pods powdered finely in a mortar-pestle, or about ½ to 1 teaspoon pre-ground cardamom powder. Mix it very well.</p>

        <p class="paragraph3">13. <b>Continue </b>to simmer on a low flame, stirring often.</p>

        <p class="paragraph3">14. <b>Simmer</b> till the gajar ka halwa mixture starts to thicken and reduces more. Stir at intervals.</p>
        
        <p class="paragraph3">15. When the halwa has reduced to a pudding-like consistency, add nuts and dry fruits of your choice. I have added 12 cashews, 12 almonds, and 2 tablespoons golden raisins.</p>
        <i>NOTE: Chop the nuts before you add. Raisins can be kept whole. If using saffron, then you can add at this step.</i>

        <p class="paragraph3">16. <b>Mix</b> again and continue to stir and simmer.</p>

        <p class="paragraph3">17. <b>Mix</b> again and continue to stir and simmer.</p>

        <p class="paragraph3">18.<b>Simmer</b> till the halwa mixture becomes dry. The milk should evaporate completely and you will see fine milk solids in the mixture. You will also see some ghee being released from the sides. 

          Remember to scrape the milk solids stuck at the sides of the kadai or pan and add them back to the carrot halwa. Some moisture is also fine in the halwa.</p>

          <p class="paragraph3">19.<b>Serve gajar ka halwa warm from the pan. Refrigerate any leftovers, warming them before serving. Garnish with some chopped dry fruits while serving.</b></p>
