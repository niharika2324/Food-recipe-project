              <p class="paragraph1"> <b>Lassi - </b><br>Lassi is a cooling, refreshing, probiotic drink perfect for the warm summer months made essentially with curd or yogurt, sugar or salt, spices or flavoring ingredients like green cardamom, saffron or rose water. Popular in Punjab and North India, there are many variations of a lassi recipe, including mango lassi, dry fruits lassi, and malai lassi. </p>
                
                <p class="paragraph2"> <b>Lassi</b> is a blended yogurt drink that is very popular in the Northern Parts of India. It is made with blending curd or yogurt with water or milk, salt or sugar and a few spices or herbs.

                  There are many variations of making this drink. Lassi is made both sweet and salty. Lassi is also a probiotic drink as obviously it is made from curd or yogurt which has gut friendly bacteria in it.
                
                  Relished in hot summers because of its cooling properties, we often make lassi using a wooden churner and blender (called as madani, in Punjabi and Hindi language). You can choose to blend the lassi ingredients in a blender or with a wired whisk or immersion blender.<br>

                 Churning the fresh Homemade Curd with the traditional Indian hand blender has its own charm, and lassi made this way tastes different, too.

              <div>
                <h2>STEPS TO MAKE</h2>
                <h3>Before you begin ensure that the whole milk curd (yogurt) is fresh and not gone sour. I always make lassi with homemade curd.

                  After the curd is well set and done, I keep it in the refrigerator for a few hours so that it gets cold.</h3><br><br>
                <p class="paragraph3"><b>1. Crush Green Cardamoms </b> First, in a mortar, take 8 to 10 green cardamom pods and crush them lightly. Then remove the husk and crush the seeds.

                  You can skip these first two steps if using pre-made ground cardamom. Add about 1 teaspoon of ground cardamom to yogurt while blending.
                </p>
        
                <p class="paragraph3">2. <b>Now</b>  crush the seeds to a fine powder.</p>
        
        
                  <p class="paragraph3">3. <b>Whisk Curd or Yogurt</b> In a bowl or pan, take 2 cups fresh chilled yogurt or homemade curd.</p>
        
                  <p class="paragraph3">4. <b>Next,</b>  with a handheld wooden churner (called madani in Hindi) or an immersion blender or a wired whisk, whip the curd until it becomes smooth.</p>
        
                  <p class="paragraph3">5. <b>The curd</b>  should be smooth before you add other ingredients to it.</p>
                  
                  <p class="paragraph3">6.<b>Sweeten the Curd and Churn</b>
                     Now add 4 to 5 tablespoons sugar or as needed.</p>
        
                  <p class="paragraph3">7.<b>Pour</b> 1 cup cold water or cold milk if you prefer. For a thicker lassi, add ½ cup of water or milk or do not add any liquids. For a thinner consistency, add 1.5 cups water or milk. </p>
        
                  <p class="paragraph3">8.<b>Now </b>begin to churn or blend the lassi mixture with the wooden churner or immersion blender or wired whisk</p>
        
                <p class="paragraph3">9. <b>Keep</b>   on churning, blending or whisking until the sugar dissolves and you see a nice frothy layer on top.

                  Apart from using using a wired whisk or an immersion blender, another method is to add the lassi ingredients in a blender. Then blend until smooth and frothy.</p>
        
                <p class="paragraph3">10. <b>Add Flavors & Serve Lassi</b>
                   Now add 1 teaspoon of the crushed cardamom powder and 10 to 12 crushed saffron strands.</p>
        
                <p class="paragraph3">11.<b>Mix</b> well. Do a taste test and add more sugar if needed.</p>
        
                <p class="paragraph3">12. <b>Add</b> cardamom powder – 5 to 6 green cardamom pods powdered finely in a mortar-pestle, or about ½ to 1 teaspoon pre-ground cardamom powder. Mix it very well.</p>
        
                <p class="paragraph3">13.<b>Pour</b>  lassi in tall glasses and serve. You can add ice cubes to your lassi if you prefer.

                  Garnish with a pinch or two of ground cardamom powder, 2 to 3 crushed saffron strands or chopped nuts. Serve this sweet lassi recipe straightaway.
                  
                  Some people store it in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days. If you plan to keep it in the refrigerator then do not add ice cubes.</p><br><br>
