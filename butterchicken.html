    <p class="paragraph1"> <b>Butter Chicken</b> Butter chicken is one of the most famous dishes associated with Indian restaurants, and if you have a craving, this is the recipe for you. Butter chicken uses tandoori chicken cooked in a tandoor (a type of Indian oven) that gives the chicken, subsequently, a wonderful smoky flavor. To replicate the smokiness, I roast the chicken in the oven and then broil it quickly. Serve this fragrant chicken dish with its decadent fiery red velvety sauce with kachumber salad, rice, or flatbread like naan.</p>

    <p class="paragraph2">Butter Chicken: A Rich and Creamy Indian Delicacy

      Butter Chicken, also known as Murgh Makhani, is a popular Indian dish that originated in the city of Delhi. It is a rich, creamy, and flavorful tomato-based curry made with marinated chicken cooked in a velvety smooth sauce, infused with the subtle flavors of butter, spices, and herbs.</p>
